        </h1>
        <p> Twitter celebrity and Los Angeles socialite, Tracey is one of Ririâ€™s best friends and collaborators. She
            struts her stuff across the web and is known far and wide for her incredible beatcraft and sample packs,
            community organizing, and just being an all around babe. Riri has fond memories eating hot wings and getting
            plastered with her bestie and when the two are together all hell breaks loose - the two are a powerhouse
            when together and everyone around them wonders why they live across the country from one another.
